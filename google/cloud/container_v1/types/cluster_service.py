class NodeConfig(proto.Message):
    r"""Parameters that describe the nodes in a cluster.

    Attributes:
        machine_type (str):
            The name of a Google Compute Engine `machine
            type <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types>`__
            (e.g. ``n1-standard-1``).

            If unspecified, the default machine type is
            ``n1-standard-1``.
        disk_size_gb (int):
            Size of the disk attached to each node,
            specified in GB. The smallest allowed disk size
            is 10GB.
            If unspecified, the default disk size is 100GB.
        oauth_scopes (Sequence[str]):
            The set of Google API scopes to be made available on all of
            the node VMs under the "default" service account.

            The following scopes are recommended, but not required, and
            by default are not included:

            -  ``https://www.googleapis.com/auth/compute`` is required
               for mounting persistent storage on your nodes.
            -  ``https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only``
               is required for communicating with **gcr.io** (the
               `Google Container
               Registry <https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/>`__).

            If unspecified, no scopes are added, unless Cloud Logging or
            Cloud Monitoring are enabled, in which case their required
            scopes will be added.
        service_account (str):
            The Google Cloud Platform Service Account to
            be used by the node VMs. If no Service Account
            is specified, the "default" service account is
            used.
        metadata (Sequence[~.cluster_service.NodeConfig.MetadataEntry]):
            The metadata key/value pairs assigned to instances in the
            cluster.

            Keys must conform to the regexp [a-zA-Z0-9-_]+ and be less
            than 128 bytes in length. These are reflected as part of a
            URL in the metadata server. Additionally, to avoid
            ambiguity, keys must not conflict with any other metadata
            keys for the project or be one of the reserved keys:
            "cluster-location" "cluster-name" "cluster-uid"
            "configure-sh" "containerd-configure-sh" "enable-os-login"
            "gci-update-strategy" "gci-ensure-gke-docker"
            "instance-template" "kube-env" "startup-script" "user-data"
            "disable-address-manager" "windows-startup-script-ps1"
            "common-psm1" "k8s-node-setup-psm1" "install-ssh-psm1"
            "user-profile-psm1" "serial-port-logging-enable"

            Values are free-form strings, and only have meaning as
            interpreted by the image running in the instance. The only
            restriction placed on them is that each value's size must be
            less than or equal to 32 KB.

            The total size of all keys and values must be less than 512
            KB.
        image_type (str):
            The image type to use for this node. Note
            that for a given image type, the latest version
            of it will be used.
        labels (Sequence[~.cluster_service.NodeConfig.LabelsEntry]):
            The map of Kubernetes labels (key/value
            pairs) to be applied to each node. These will
            added in addition to any default label(s) that
            Kubernetes may apply to the node.
            In case of conflict in label keys, the applied
            set may differ depending on the Kubernetes
            version -- it's best to assume the behavior is
            undefined and conflicts should be avoided.
            For more information, including usage and the
            valid values, see:
            https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-
            with-objects/labels/
        local_ssd_count (int):
            The number of local SSD disks to be attached
            to the node.
            The limit for this value is dependent upon the
            maximum number of disks available on a machine
            per zone. See:
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-
            ssd for more information.
        tags (Sequence[str]):
            The list of instance tags applied to all
            nodes. Tags are used to identify valid sources
            or targets for network firewalls and are
            specified by the client during cluster or node
            pool creation. Each tag within the list must
            comply with RFC1035.
        preemptible (bool):
            Whether the nodes are created as preemptible
            VM instances. See:
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/preemptible
            for more information about preemptible VM
            instances.
        accelerators (Sequence[~.cluster_service.AcceleratorConfig]):
            A list of hardware accelerators to be
            attached to each node. See
            https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/gpus for
            more information about support for GPUs.
        disk_type (str):
            Type of the disk attached to each node (e.g.
            'pd-standard' or 'pd-ssd')
            If unspecified, the default disk type is 'pd-
            standard'
        min_cpu_platform (str):
            Minimum CPU platform to be used by this instance. The
            instance may be scheduled on the specified or newer CPU
            platform. Applicable values are the friendly names of CPU
            platforms, such as minCpuPlatform: "Intel Haswell" or
            minCpuPlatform: "Intel Sandy Bridge". For more information,
            read `how to specify min CPU
            platform <https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/specify-min-cpu-platform>`__
        taints (Sequence[~.cluster_service.NodeTaint]):
            List of kubernetes taints to be applied to
            each node.

            span of time between the start and end time.

            For example, to have something repeat every
            weekday, you'd use:
            <code>FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR</code> To
            repeat some window daily (equivalent to the
            DailyMaintenanceWindow):
            <code>FREQ=DAILY</code>
            For the first weekend of every month:
            <code>FREQ=MONTHLY;BYSETPOS=1;BYDAY=SA,SU</code>
            This specifies how frequently the window starts.
            Eg, if you wanted to have a 9-5 UTC-4 window
            every weekday, you'd use something like: <code>
              start time = 2019-01-01T09:00:00-0400
              end time = 2019-01-01T17:00:00-0400
              recurrence = FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR
            </code>
            Windows can span multiple days. Eg, to make the
            window encompass every weekend from midnight
            Saturday till the last minute of Sunday UTC:
            <code>
              start time = 2019-01-05T00:00:00Z

            largely arbitrary except to specify duration of
            the window and when it first starts. The FREQ
